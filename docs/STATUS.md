# Jue's Baby Co. — Current State (SINGLE-PAGE HANDOFF)
**As of:** 2026-10-24
**Overall:** V8 LIVE DEMO INTACT; S5A CLOUD CATALOGUE + OWNER ALLOWLIST DEPLOYED AND NEGATIVE RLS TESTS PASSED; NO PROVISIONED OWNER, NO POSITIVE LOGIN OR CROSS-DEVICE BROWSER TEST.
**Current focus:** S5B — approve an actual Auth owner, test login and cross-device cloud updates. S5 remains OPEN.

## Proven by owner-reported testing
- GitHub Pages storefront opens.
- Responsive mobile and desktop layout is working (V8).
- Demo checkout creates a simulation reference; screenshot shown.
- Name and phone fields requested as part of checkout.
- Dashboard edits a sample price and storefront reflects it in same browser.

## Code-verified but not independently browser-e2e-tested
- `index.html` includes product search, age filters, sorting, favorites, cart controls and checkout flow.
- `owner-demo.html` includes create/edit/hide/delete local sample records, JPEG compression, stock quantities, JSON export.
- Both scripts parsed successfully in prior tool validation; this is not a proof all flows work.

## Known boundaries
- Public demo: **NO real purchases, payments, reservations, shipment, stock accounting or server orders**.
- Existing `owner-demo.html` is a PUBLIC browser-local prototype with NO authentication. New `owner-cloud.html` has Supabase Auth and database-enforced owner membership but is still STAGING with no approved owners.
- Old demo edits use localStorage only. New staged cloud products are centrally stored in Supabase, but user-level cross-device acceptance has **NOT** been tested.
- Demo product photos and prices are NOT verified inventory.
- Real customer data must not be entered in demo.
- Old simple checkout phone regex is not country-grade phone verification; do not claim it is.

## Current account isolation
- GitHub: account `juesbabyco`, repo `juesbabyco/jues-baby-website`. MindCare GitHub must remain untouched.
- Supabase: **only** connected Juesbabyco organization `cgqjblrthxmahtqmwzjz`; dedicated project `jues-baby-co`, id `izeezajdiawiaweffbrh`, region `eu-west-1`, created 2026-10-24, status ACTIVE_HEALTHY.
- Quoted creation cost: **US$0/month**, explicitly approved by user and confirmed with Supabase. Recheck before enabling paid services.
- Separate MindCare Supabase exists under a different connection; DO NOT use it.
- Verified private schema `jues_internal` with tables `project_registry` (1 row) and `stage_events` (6 events after final status update); both RLS-enabled. Anonymous and authenticated users have no schema usage, table SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE privileges verified denied. This is internal governance only.
- Supabase migration: `20261024115601_jues_private_development_registry_v1`; matching source at `supabase/migrations/20261024115601_jues_private_development_registry_v1.sql`.
- Security advisor: 2 INFO `rls_enabled_no_policy` on intentionally inaccessible private governance tables; no other security lint returned. Performance advisor: 2 INFO unused indexes (new, empty product table). Overlapping permissive SELECT policy warning was fixed in migration `20261024122310`.

## Stage 5A implementation and evidence
- SQL migration `20261024121448_jues_stage5_owner_and_product_catalogue` created `public.jues_store_owners` and `public.jues_products`, both RLS-enabled, six policies overall after optimization.
- SQL migration `20261024122310_jues_stage5_streamline_read_policies` removes authenticated duplicate-permissive SELECT lint. Both migration files mirrored in GitHub.
- Permission tests: `anon` INSERT denied (42501); `authenticated` unapproved-user INSERT denied by RLS (42501); authenticated cannot grant itself owner membership.
- Rolled-back public visibility test showed one temporary published record and zero temporary draft records; subsequent row count was 0 products and 0 approved owners, 0 Auth users.
- Staged pages committed: `owner-cloud.html` and `cloud-preview.html`; both JavaScript syntax-verified, **not** browser end-to-end confirmed. Pinned supabase-js 2.118.0, publishable key only; no privileged key.
- Supabase governance registry now reports `S5A_CLOUD_CATALOGUE`, 11 events; Stage 5 still OPEN.
- Current user guide: `docs/STAGE5_OWNER_SETUP.md`.

## Next action and gates
1. Create/invite the intended owner in **Jue's** Supabase Authentication → Users, without sharing the password; confirm actual Auth UUID.
2. Privileged onboarding: add that *verified* Auth UUID to `public.jues_store_owners`. Do not grant on email guesswork or allow public self-assignment.
3. Open `owner-cloud.html` and test owner login, product draft creation and update.
4. Test a published product in `cloud-preview.html` on a **second independent browser/device**. Confirm draft remains hidden and an outsider write is denied.
5. Record test evidence in GitHub and Supabase before marking S5 closed; keep original V8 customer demo untouched until accepted.

## Stop conditions
- Wrong Supabase link, project, or org -> STOP.
- Unexpected bill/cost -> STOP and ask.
- Any write affecting MindCare -> STOP.
- Missing owner authority/RLS -> no production CRUD.
- Unknown stock or demo listing -> keep explicit DEMO labeling.
